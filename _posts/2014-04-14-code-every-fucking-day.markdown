> "And so he git, push, git, push, code..." Kick, Push - Lupe Fiasco ([well, not exactly](http://rapgenius.com/Lupe-fiasco-kick-push-lyrics))

I've been inspired by the John Resig post, [Write Code Every Day](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/).

My current streak of commits on Github stands at 7 days. While Github commits aren't exactly the best indicator of coding every day(you can just add some comments, for example), it is a good way to keep track of my consistency, so I'll try to keep my streak alive as long as I can.

This may cause an issue on days I spend going through exercises on a site like [Code School](http://www.codeschool.com) or [Node School](http://nodeschool.io), so I'll have to figure something out there.

My main focus moving forward will be gaining a deeper understanding of javascript. I can focus on one language that I can use to continue learning the full stack. I'll be increasing my knowledge of vanilla js which will help me when using frameworks/libraries like AngularJS, node.js, jQuery, etc.

I'll still be working on my current Rails projects and learning more Ruby when I can. I'll also be diving into Adobe Photoshop and Dreamweaver. I feel like it's a valuable skill to have when developing on the front-end, and could offer me a leg up when job searching.

Ah yes, the dreaded job search. I've been searching for a full-time job since my Web Development Immersive cohort in Los Angeles, CA graduated late December 2013. It seems there isn't a huge demand for junior web developers in L.A. at the moment, so I'm looking to strengthen my skillset to that of a mid-level developer.

One great way to do that? Code. Every. Fucking. Day.
