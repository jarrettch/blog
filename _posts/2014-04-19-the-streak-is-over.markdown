Well, that didn't last long.

My Github streak of pushing code everyday came to an end at 10 days. All is not lost, as that gives me a chance to start a new streak, right.

The main thing is coding everyday, which I've been pretty good about. I missed pushing to Github on Thursday because I wasn't home most of the day. I had a full day of interviews and then went to the movies at night, so I missed my opportunity to git push.

Friday, I spent most of the day at General Assembly, attending the Apprenticeship session. It goes without saying I coded here, but most of the exercises and things we go over during these sessions I don't keep repos for. We went over design patterns in Ruby on Rails and looked at building our own CSS compiler.

Unfortunately I haven't gotten much work done on the couple personal projects I have. Hopefully I can change that this weekend and get back on track.

One thing I notice about the so-called "Rockstar Coders" is that many of them have tons of activity on their Github. I don't have any delusions of granduer about becoming a Rockstar Coder but there's no denying it, the main way to get better at coding is to actually code.

Onward!
