So I've been going over algos. They're unavoidable when it comes to computer programming job searches.

I was asked earlier today, "You guys are so pissed off about technical questions, but so eager to show your skills."

I knew the meaning of the statement. Many programmers that are looking for work are upset about the current hiring process. Do I really need to know about algorithms to build websites with Ruby on Rails?

Probably not.

Will it help?

Probably not. But it can't hurt.

People like myself that went through bootcamps don't get the luxury of six months learning the most esoteric of algorithms that were conceived in the 70s. But we're competing with those people in the job market, so we should know about them.

I've been looking into algos myself. Part 2 is coming up soon.
