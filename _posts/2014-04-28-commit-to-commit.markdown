They can't all be home runs.

This is my commit to commit.

What have I been working on? Lots of stuff. I'm forever intrigued by javascript, AngularJS and their ilk.

Javascript frameworks are getting out of control though. Pick one. I pick Angular for now. Google is behind it, there are good projects behind it like the UI team, and it's awesome.

I even tried to look at some C# this weekend. Not much. But it doesn't seem too bad to work with. And Visual Studio actually looks like a great IDE. Did Microsoft REALLY make a product people like? It's possible...

The algos post will come later tonight or tomorrow. For now, the LA Kings are fighting for their playoff life.
